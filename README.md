# Grade4U Website
Our project is a grading system that allows multiple permissions for users: student and lecturer.
The system allows the lecturer to manage all his courses from the start of the course, checking the registry, giving scores and checking the histogram of the score distribution.
A student will be able to enroll in courses, keep track of his grades and get an weighted average for all his grades.
